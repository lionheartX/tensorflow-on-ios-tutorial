# tensorflow-on-ios-tutorial
Experiment running Tensorflow on iOS following [this tutorial](http://machinethink.net/blog/tensorflow-on-ios/)
<br> As of now, running Tensorflow on iOS is very cumbersome. Tensorflow iOS API only supports C++ (no Swift yet), you need to build Tensorflow from source, and you risk people stealing your model on the device. Not recommended.
- Tensorflow on iOS (CPU).
- TODO: Running neural net using Metal on iOS (GPU).
