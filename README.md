Experiment running Tensorflow on iOS following [this tutorial](http://machinethink.net/blog/tensorflow-on-ios/)
<br> As of now, running Tensorflow on iOS is very cumbersome. Tensorflow iOS API only supports C++ (no Swift yet), you need to build Tensorflow from source.
- Tensorflow on iOS (CPU).
- TODO: Running neural net using Metal on iOS (GPU).
