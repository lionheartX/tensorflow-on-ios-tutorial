# tensorflow-on-ios-tutorial
Experiment running Tensorflow on iOS following [this tutorial](http://machinethink.net/blog/tensorflow-on-ios/)
<br> As of now, running Tensorflow on iOS is very cumbersome. Not only you need to install Tensorflow from source, but also other people can easily steal your machine learning model file from app bundle. Not recommended.
- Tensorflow on iOS (CPU).
- TODO: Running neural net using Metal on iOS (GPU).
